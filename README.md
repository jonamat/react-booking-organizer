React booking management PWA app.<br>
The app allows the registration of reservations for a specific requested service, assigned to a particular employee at a specific time. All registered bookings will be displayed in a formatted table sorted by time and employee, one table each day.<br>
It allows multiple users to interact with the same table in real time, in order to avoid overlapping reservations, assignments to employees not in service or on vacation and view the working hours table for each employee.<br>
It also provides a small feature to remind you of a customer's upcoming birthday.<br>
Designed for the front office of a beauty center, it can ideally be used for all activities that need to individually serve several customers, like accounting firms, gyms, spa, law firms and schools with private instructors.
